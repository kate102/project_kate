# project_kate

## Introduction
I have identified that there are several areas that I want to concentrate on simultaneously in the last few weeks of Makers Academy and for the weeks immediately after.
So that I can manage this 'project' effectively I am going to contain all of the disparate areas in one website.

The areas that I need to cover are:
- Completing a selection of the challenges that were set in Makers that would cement my understanding and skills in 4 specific areas
  - Being able to program fluently, refactor and write easily modifiable code
  - Being able to demonstrate TDD across a variety of platforms and languages
  - Being able to write a full stack application
  - Being able to write a specific program in several different languages with different paradigms
- Identify weak areas in my learning and take on challenges outside Makers that will address these.
- Practice good process when I am working independently, including estimating, timeboxing and using the trello board
- Consolidate in one place all of the information I would want employers to see.

# Idiots Guide
I am now 6 months into a front end dev role at Deloitte Digital and its high time I have some more thought into my personal website
One of the things that I realised is that I can't recall how I got this far 9 months ago when I last worked on it so, in order that I don't waste time next time working out the basics, I'm going to write an Idiots Guide...
